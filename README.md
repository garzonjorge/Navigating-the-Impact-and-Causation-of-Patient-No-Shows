# Healthcare No-Show Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to understand and predict patient no-show behavior in healthcare settings. By analyzing electronic health records (EHR) and various qualitative data sources, we develop predictive models to identify factors contributing to missed appointments and their impact on patient health outcomes.

## Objectives
- Predict patient attendance status
- Identify significant factors influencing no-show behavior
- Develop actionable strategies to reduce no-shows

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Electronic Health Records (EHR)
   - Literature review (surveys, interviews, reports)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dataset cleaning and consistency checks
   - Handling of anomalies (e.g., negative age values)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualization techniques for variable relationships
   - Correlation analysis using heatmaps

4. **Modeling**
   - Linear and logistic regression
   - Ensemble methods (boosting/bagging)
   - Model evaluation based on predictive accuracy

5. **Insight Derivation**
   - Identifying key factors affecting no-show behavior
   - Developing actionable strategies

## Data Source
- Kaggle dataset (chosen for its cleanliness and completeness)

## Key Challenges
- Interpreting ambiguous data (e.g., negative age values)
- Selecting influential variables for modeling
- Minimizing multicollinearity

## Future Work
- Further refinement of predictive models
- Implementation of strategies to reduce no-show rates
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of interventions

This project contributes to improving healthcare efficiency and patient outcomes by addressing the critical issue of appointment no-shows.
